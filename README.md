## page by page walkthrough of website features
1. base.html- This is an unviewable webpage that's used to create continuity in design for all the website pages. 
2. index.html - This is the start page of the website, it displays a welcome message and the ability to sign in/register for an account. I made this file independent of the base.html file.
3.editrecipe.html - This page allows you to recipe existing recipes.

## Potential future features
On The website statistics pages I didnt know how to get the graphs and tables to update automatically so it has to be done manually. 
Adding a piechart that can display allergens. The issue was allergens was a list and i was unable to workout how to call the allergens lists and convert the format to work on the piechart.
